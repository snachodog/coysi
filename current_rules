All posts must comply with the Facebook Community Standards (https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/) and Facebook Commerce Policies (https://www.facebook.com/policies/commerce). Since Facebook has put the onus on group admins, we are going to have to start enforcing them more strictly.

Some highlights from these rules that are relevant to our group:
No guns, gun products or other weapons are allowed to be sold on Facebook
No animals or animal by-products may be sold on Facebook including pets, livestock, or any part, pelt or skin from an animal, including fur
No tickets (we donâ€™t have clarification, so no raffle tickets or event tickets may be sold)
1. Respect each other: harassment and/or disparaging remarks will result in permanent removal from the group.
2. All items for sale must include a price and a location.
3. If you are posting more than two items please make an album
4. No more than one bump of your post in 24 hours
6. Business advertisement is not allowed. Please post to Acantha Business Marketplace instead. Non-profits and non-profit fundraising, and job listings are exempt from this rule.
7. Once your item is sold, or you find the item you were looking for, please delete your post. It helps keep the group search function easy to use.
8. As a precautionary measure, users who post spammy posts will be removed from the group - just to make sure it's not a hacked account. Once you have taken control of your account, you are welcome to rejoin the group.
