Based on feedback from members of the group, and as a means to return the group to a place for person-to-person interactions, beginning on May 27, 2016 business advertisements of all kinds will be disallowed in the Choteau Online Yard Sale And Information group. Instead, we ask that everybody in this group join our new business specific group, Acantha Business Marketplace. The new group is for businesses only and will be visible to everyone so that you can maximize your advertising.
Additionally, Stewart and I ask that you please review the guidelines of the group:
1. Respect each other: harassment and/or disparaging remarks will result in permanent removal from the group.
2. All items for sale must include a price, and a location.
3. If you are posting more than two times please make an album
4. No more then one bump of your post in 24 hours
5. Falsification, selling of stolen goods, animal mills/farmed animals (i.e., non-livestock) will be banned from the group and may be reported to Sheriff's Department.
6. Business advertisement is not allowed. Please post to the Acantha Business Marketplace instead. Non-profits, non-profit fundraising, and job listings are exempt from this rule.
7. Once your item is sold, or you find the item you were looking for, please delete your post or mark your item as sold. It helps keep the group search function easy to use.
8. As a precautionary measure, users who post spammy posts will be removed from the group - just to make sure it's not a hacked account. Once you have taken control of your account, you are welcome to rejoin the group.
